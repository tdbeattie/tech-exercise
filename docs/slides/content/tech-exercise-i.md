### Tech Practice I
[The Manual Menace](http://rht-labs.com/StarWarsIntroCreator/#!/AN-PkHf-k0FgxKTTKRcA)



#### What is it?
Everything as Code is the practice of treating all parts of the system as code. This means:
![what-it-is](images/tech-exercise-i/what-it-is.png) <!-- .element: class="image-no-shadow image-full-width" -->
<!--
* Storing configuration along with Source Code in a repository such as git.
* All manual steps are scripted, automated, and checked into a source control management system.
* Storing all the things! From bottom to top - infrastructure, operating systems, build configurations, application properties, deployment configurations, etc.

### Why do we do it?


### Why do we do it?

* **Traceability**: Storing your environment descriptions and structure in a version control system allows you to audit changes made to the system, tracked to the individual who made them.
* **Repeatability**: Moving from one cloud provider to another should be a simple task. Picking a deployment target is like shopping around for the best price that week. By storing all things as code, systems can be recreated in moments on various providers.
* **GitOps**: A single source of truth means that you no longer need tribal knowledge or experts to set up cables or attach hard drives.


### Why do we do it?
* **Phoenix Server**: No more fears of configuration drift. If a server needs to be patched or randomly dies, that's OK. Just create it again from scratch using the stored configuration.
* **Cross-functional Teams**: Writing all things as code improves collaboration between silos in an organization. The development team can contribute to the environment creation or can recreate their own like-for-like environments in a sandbox.
* **De-risking**: Changes can be applied to environments or application deployments and reverted to previous states quickly, thus reducing the risk associated with big upgrades of any kind.



### How do we do it?


### How do we do it?
1. Select automated tools for provisioning and configuration, such as Ansible, templating, bash, etc.
2. Write installation and configuration sequences as code.
3. Design configuration options as templates.
4. Check source configuration code into a source control repository.
5. Use the automated tools to apply your configurations.
